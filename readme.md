[**üåçÈòÖËØª‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÊú¨**](./readme_cn.md)

A lightweight companion utility for Cloudlog/Wavelog that automatically uploads current rig status and real-time QSO data. Supports most mainstream radios and seamless integration with JTDX/WSJT-X!

If your computer struggles with performance or you simply need an automated QSO/rig data upload solution, give Cloudlog Helper a try!

The application interface fully supports both **English** and **‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese)**, While most screenshots in this documentation currently display the Chinese interface, you can easily switch languages in settings!

## üíª Supported Platforms

+ Windows 7 SP1+
+ Ubuntu 20.04+ and other mainstream Linux distributions
+ macOS support under development...

## ‚ö° Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> You may also choose to compile from source - refer to the "Compilation" section below.

1. Download the appropriate version for your OS from Releases. **Linux users requiring radio data reporting should launch the software with `sudo`**.

2. Open the application and navigate to `Settings` ‚Üí `Basic Settings`.

### üìå Cloudlog Configuration

1. Enter your Cloudlog/Wavelog server URL and API KEY. Follow these steps to obtain them:

   <img src="./md_assets/image-20250510205625912.png" alt="API Key Retrieval" width="80%" />

2. Click "Test". Upon successful validation, a station ID dropdown will appear below the API key field. Select the correct ID if you maintain multiple stations in Cloudlog/Wavelog - all subsequent QSOs will be uploaded to this station.

### üìå Hamlib Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> Skip this section if you don't require automatic radio data reporting.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling JTDX/WSJT-X will grant it exclusive radio control. Refer to "Working with JTDX" for coexistence solutions.

This feature periodically uploads radio parameters (frequency, mode, etc.) to your Cloudlog server. When logging QSOs, Cloudlog automatically populates these fields, eliminating manual entry errors. Your Cloudlog dashboard will also display real-time radio data.

1. Select your radio model from the dropdown
2. Choose the correct COM port
3. Click "Test" before enabling "Automatic Radio Data Reporting"
4. Save configurations with "Confirm"

<img src="./md_assets/hamlib.png" width="50%" />

5. The main interface should now display radio data. Verify on your Cloudlog dashboard:

<img src="./md_assets/image-20250511120812425.png" width="50%" />

6. Select your radio under "Station" - Cloudlog will now auto-populate frequency/mode during QSO logging.

<img src="./md_assets/image-20250510221120607.png" width="50%" />

### üìå UDP Server Configuration

This functions similarly to GridTracker. JTDX broadcasts decoded callsigns/frequency/reports via UDP, which CloudlogHelper captures and uploads to your Cloudlog server.

1. Default settings usually suffice. If modifying the port, ensure JTDX's UDP settings match.
   
   **Important**: For cross-device operation, enable "Allow External Connections" and set JTDX's UDP IP to Cloudlog Helper's host IP.

<img src="./md_assets/image-20250510222349765.png" width="60%" />

2. The interface will display transmission status and completed QSOs:

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### üéØ JTDX/WSJT-X Integration

To enable concurrent radio data reporting while running JTDX:

JTDX assumes exclusive radio control, preventing direct frequency reading from other applications. Cloudlog helper provides a proxy server which mediates requests, prioritizing and sequencing commands to prevent conflicts (see "Conflict Resolution" for details).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Third-party apps (JTDX/WSJT-X) receive highest priority. "Radio Communication Timeout" warnings during their operation may be safely ignored.

**Implementation (Windows 7 example)**:

1. In Cloudlog Helper:
   - Configure radio settings
   - Enable "Automatic Radio Data Reporting"
   - Enable "Request Proxy" (do **not** disable PTT control - required by JTDX)
   - Apply changes

2. In JTDX:
   - Set `Radio Device` to `Hamlib NET rigctl`
   - Enter proxy server address (default: 127.0.0.1:7584) in CAT control
   - Maintain original PTT settings

   <img src="./md_assets/image-20250517151541410.png" width="70%" />

3. Verify CAT/PTT functionality before finalizing.

4. Successful integration should appear as:

   <img src="./md_assets/image-20250510140025232.png" width="70%" />

### üéØ Conflict Resolution Architecture

Multiple clients sharing a rigctld instance may cause processing conflict. Integrated proxy server sequences requests according to priority:

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

Requires `.NET 6.0+` and `gcc`. (Linux x64 example - other OSes reference `.github/workflows/build.yml` (TBD))

```shell
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/SydneyOwl/cloudlog-helper.git
```

### üî® Hamlib Compilation

Optional (skip if not using radio features). We only require `rigctld` - Hamlib's radio control daemon.

```shell
# Dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential gcc g++ cmake make libusb-dev libudev-dev

cd cloudlog-helper/hamlib
./bootstrap

# Optimized build (adapted from WSJT-X)
./configure --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> --disable-shared --enable-static --without-cxx-binding \
CFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections"

make -j4 all
make install-strip DESTDIR=""
```

Locate `rigctld` in `./<INSTALL_DIR>/bin`.

### üî® Application Compilation

```shell
cd cloudlog-helper
dotnet restore -r linux-x64
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true
```

The compiled output resides in `bin/Release/net6.0/linux-64`. Place `rigctld` (if compiled) in this directory.
